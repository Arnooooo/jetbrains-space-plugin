    <p>Merge request must be approved by all invited reviewers to trigger the build.</p>
    <p>The list of reviewers shouldn't be empty.
        The build will get triggered as soon as the last reviewer approves merge request.
        The build will also get triggered for each subsequent push to the merge request source branch, provided that all the reviewers have finalized their approval (the approval won't get reset on new commits).</p>
