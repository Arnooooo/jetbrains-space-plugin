    <p>This build configuration will be used for running safe merges in JetBrains Space.</p>
    <p>
        Safe merge is a feature that allows running checks for a merge request on a temporary merge commit before those changes are integrated into protected branch.
        See more details about safe merge in the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/space/branch-and-merge-restrictions.html#safe-merge">JetBrains Space documentation</a>.
