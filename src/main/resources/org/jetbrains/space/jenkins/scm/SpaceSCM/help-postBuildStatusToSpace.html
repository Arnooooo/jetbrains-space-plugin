    <p>If checked, Jenkins will automatically report build to Space without the need to add any steps to the job or workflow definition.</p>
    <p>Build will be reported as running upon build start and as succeeded or failed upon build completion.</p>
    <p>Git commit and branch name for reporting will be taken from the GIT_COMMIT and GIT_BRANCH environment variables.
        Those <a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/git/#plugin-content-environment-variables">environment variables</a> are provided by Jenkins standard Git plugin when source code is checked out from a git repository.</p>
